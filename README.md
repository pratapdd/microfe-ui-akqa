## MicroFrontend Architectures

### Implementation Details :-

Micro frontend architectures help us build maintainable and scalable Micro services of UI build, so each service can be independently written in the choice of technology the Team wants.
It also help use to have better separation of concern between these scalable components.
Each component will act like an independent App and can be developed and released independently.
